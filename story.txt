Rusty was late to report bact to The Fat Controller again. "Where have you been?" inquired the controller. "I was helping Rheneas on his line!", exclaimed Rusty. 
The Fat Controller sighed. They were having problems with Rheneas's tracks. As it was a mountainous path, rocks and fallen trees often cluttered the railway lines. Many engines had to work together to clear the tracks.
The next day, Rusty got to work helping Rheneas again. When they were working, there was busy traffic on the road parallel to the railway line.
